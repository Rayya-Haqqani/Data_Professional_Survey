# Power BI Dashboard - Data Professionals Survey Breakdown
This repository contains my Power BI project where I created a comprehensive and visually engaging dashboard based on a dataset from a survey conducted on data professionals.

**Key Features:**

Data cleaning performed using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to ensure accurate and meaningful insights.

Developed a user-friendly dashboard that provides insights into key metrics, trends, and distributions within the data professional community.

Visualizations highlight demographic information, skill sets, career preferences, and industry trends among data professionals.
